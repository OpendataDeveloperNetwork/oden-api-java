# oden-api-java

<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>The purpose of these libraries is to allow developers to convert the unified data set
	into Java objects. Each package includes parsers to read in the data as well as methods
	to search, sort, and access the data as a collection of Java objects.\n
	Each package in "oden-api-java" includes Java class files and a pre-packaged JAR file
	for developers to use in their projects. Each package corresponds to an oden converter and
	open data set.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
	<p>For Java files and libraries to work correctly Gson 2.8.2 must be included as a referenced library
	in your Java project. The latest version of Gson can be downloaded 
	<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson">Here.</a></p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>To use the oden Java libraries either directly import the Java class files or simply
	add the appropriate JAR file as a referenced library in you Java project.</p>
